# Data-Science
This repository contains projects, representing my Data-Analyst scills.

Folder "Data Analyst" contains analysis projects, such as:
- Real_estate_market_analysis 

Based on the Yandex.Realty service data, the market value was determined
real estate objects of different types, typical parameters of apartments, depending on
distance from the center. Data preprocessing has been carried out. Added new data.
Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots are constructed.

- Research_of_a_favorable_tariff_for_a_telecom_company

A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out,
analyzed the behavior of customers when using the services of the operator and
recommended optimal sets of services for users. Pre-processing done
data, their analysis. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and
difference in revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions.

- Research_of_reliability_of_bank_customers

Based on the data of the credit department of the bank, he studied the influence of marital status and
the number of children for the fact of loan repayment on time. Information was received about
data. Identified and processed omissions. Replaced data types with appropriate ones
stored data. Removed duplicates. Categorized data.

- Research_of_service_"Yandex.Music"

Using real data from Yandex.Music, an analysis was made of the musical preferences of users in the two cities. Dependences of preferences on the day of the week and time of day were determined.

- Research_of_the_technological_process_of_gold_refining

A machine learning model is being built for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

Folder "Machine Learning" contains projects where ML is used.
- Creating_a_model_for_determining_the_cost_of_a_car

A used car service is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Based on historical data, it is necessary to build a model to determine the value of the car.

- Determination_of_the_most_profitable_oil_production_region

Oil samples were provided in three regions. The characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the most profit.

It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Provided historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.

- Protecting_the_data_of_insurance_company_customers

It is necessary to protect the data of clients of the insurance company "Though the Flood". Develop a data transformation method that makes it difficult to recover personal information from it. Justify the correctness of his work. You need to protect the data so that the quality of the machine learning models does not deteriorate during the transformation. There is no need to select the best model.

- Research_of_the_technological_process_of_gold_refining

A machine learning model is being built for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

- Telecom_customers_classification

The mobile operator found out: many customers use archival tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users one of the new tariffs.
